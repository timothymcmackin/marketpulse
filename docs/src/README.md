## The objective is to maintain this tutorial up to date at every release of products within Etherlink ecosystem, so every developer can find quickly what they need  

- How to setup the dev tooling
- Start coding in Solidity - Create an account and get money using the faucet
- Test your local smart contract
- Use Hardhat to deploy your contract to Etherlink
- Verify your contract on the Etherlink explorer
- Create a frontend application to interact with your smart contract using Viem and Thirdweb
- Design your CI/CD pipelines with Github Actions and deploy the frontend with Vercel

## What is not

- A learning class for Solidity or Hardhat
- A learning class for frontend technology, Viem, etc ...
- A final recommendation on restricted products from the Etherlink ecosystem. You can interchange technologies for smart contract languages, IDE, indexers, oracles, frontend framework, etc ...
